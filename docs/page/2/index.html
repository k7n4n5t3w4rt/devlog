          <p><em>Pick no more than two important precursor sources for your current research. They can be theoretical and/or practical. Briefly describe how they have impacted on your research/work and/or how your research practice has impacted or changed your understanding of them. The value in this online writing lies in being brief and clear; choose your words carefully. One or two short paragraphs should be all you need. [Consider the selected sources in relation to your topic, aims and objectives and the identified keywords].</em></p>
<p>The first is Neuromancer written by William Gibson in 1984. This book spawned a SciFi genre called “cyberpunk”. In it, Gibson used the term “cyberspace” (coined a few years earlier in a short story) and described a networked data-space called the “matrix” that was basically a VR interface for the internet. Pretty amazing considering the internet had barely existed for about a year before the book came out.</p>
<p>The second is another William Gibson book written 23 years later called Spook Country. In contrast to the far future setting of Neuromancer, this story is an alternative history of the near (like, 12 months) past. Locative art (where virtual scultptures are situated in real locations) is part of the plot.</p>
<p>I think these works are important to the project because they’re both by GIbson and show a change in his understanding over time. This is from an interview with Gibson in 2007:</p>
<p>When I started, I thought that the “locative art” stuff would work the way immersion technology did in my earlier fiction. Then I started liking that it wasn’t going to do that…cyberspace is inverting, turning inside out. I have a feeling that being aware of being connected will be an anachronism, because we’ll be connected all the time. I have this inkling that the whole idea of cyberspace is going to seem fabulously quaint in 20 or 30 years. ~ <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/35536/">http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/35536/</a></p>

          <p><em>Make a list of key terms, disciplines and subject areas that may be related to your area of practice as well as the principle concepts of your practice.</em></p>
<h3 id="Key-Terms"><a href="#Key-Terms" class="headerlink" title="Key Terms"></a>Key Terms</h3><ul>
<li><p>“Cyberspace”: A term first used in speculative fiction by William Gibson in reference to shared spatial visualisation of a world-wide computer network - “a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system.” (1984, p69). In he following decades, the term use has been also metaphorical and it became synonymous with the World Wide Web, describing the imaginary, shared space of communication and representation online.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Mirror Worlds”: A term coined by David Gelernter in his 1991 book “Mirror worlds, or, The day software puts the universe in a shoebox : how it will happen and what it will mean.” (Gelernter 1991) Mirror worlds are virtual representations of data space. They may utilise world-space but they may also represent data in other ways that better allow for navigation and interpretation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“World space”: A term from spatial computing (c.1997) meaning the shared 3D space of a scene, as opposed to the relative 3D space of a single object in a scene. Frequently found in technical documentation of 3D programming frameworks, eg: “Returns a vector representing the position of the object in world space.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Internet of Things”: “interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people … with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction” (Wikipedia Contributors 2019)</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Web of Things”: In the same way the Web is a layer of shared protocols (an “application layer”) for the Internet (the “network layer”), “Web of Things” describes the proposed standards for an application layer that simplifies the creation of applications for the “Internet of Things”. Competing approaches include a framework from Mozilla (Mozilla IoT 2019) and a draft specification from the W3C (Web of Things (WoT) Architecture 2017)</p>
</li>
<li><p>“XR (X Reality): “the union between ubiquitous sensor/actuator networks and shared online virtual worlds” (Landay &amp; Paradiso 2009)</p>
</li>
<li><p>“Locative Art”: Art that is digital and also concerned directly with the physical space of the world. In the early days (before phones) people used protable GPS devices and the work tended to be very perfomative and interactive. When AR became possible, the focus shifted to that. The 2002 book “Spook Country” by William Gibson suggested an art practice like this before it really existed.</p>

          <p><em>Why complete the study? Why is it necessary?</em></p>
<p>The imminent arrival of augmented-reality marks a turning point in the way we interact with the internet, on par with the shift from desktop to mobile. A practice-led research project based on these same technologies, that explores and critiques the new modes of human-computer interaction this shift will bring, is timely.</p>
<p><em>Make a list of any evidence that exists to support your belief that your proposed research is worthwhile and necessary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will look into a computer screen and see reality. Some part of your world the town you live in, the company you work for, your school system, the city hospital - will hang there in a sharp color image, abstract but recognizable, moving subtly in a thousand places. This Mirror World you are looking at is fed by a steady rush of new data pouring in through cables. It is infiltrated by your own software creatures, doing your business. (Gelernter 1991)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People have been thinking about, and building, “mirror worlds” since William Gibson coined the term “cyberspace” in 1982. Before that, really - perhaps when we started measuring time and making maps of the world. But even Gibson didn’t foresee the way we would be mix the digital and the real. The “internet of things” is development developing rapidly. Low level 5G networks and high-level “web of things” protocols will bring isolated proprietary networks of “things” into the internet, improvements in GPS mean that we will soon know the location of things in world space within 30cm (currently we have only 4m accuracy at best). Machine learning is being offered as a service, for example by Google Cloud Services, Microsoft Axure and Amazon Web Services. It effectively extends the reach of the Web of Things to include things that are not, in themselves, networked, but are represented (could we say “known by the network”?) through their data. Consumer level XR (“extended reality”) interface technology is the hot area for Silicon Valley startups and venture capitalists. All these developments are converging to enmesh the internet into our physical world and our lives to an unprecedented extent. We will be living in the mirror-worlds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we’ve been growing a sort of prosthetic extended nervous system for the last hundred years or so and its really starting to take, you know? It’s rich. It’s really starting to grow now. We’re dealing with something that has penetrated virtually every corner of the human universe now. It’s increasingly difficult to find people who have not been affected by media. It’s very difficult to find non mediated human beings (Gibson 2000)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now is the time to start trying to measure the effects technology is having on us as humans. How has technology changed us in the last hundred years - or even in the last 40 years or so? Our experiences of the “real” are about to become heavily mediated by digital technology in a way that none of us have experienced before and few of us can imagine. The effects of this phase change change over the next decade may be more profound than the changes we have experienced since the internet was invented.</p>
<p>Through a combination of practice and measurement techniques from the field of complexity theory, this project will explore and attempt, however vainly and poetically, to measure the changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we were only several hundred-thousand years old, we built stone circles, water clocks. Later, someone forged an iron spring, set clockwork running, imagined grid-lines on a globe. Cathedrals are like machines defining the soul; bells of clock towers stitch the sleeper’s dreams together. You see? So we’ve always been on our way to this new place ― that is no place, really ― but is real. It’s our nature to represent: we’re the animal that represents, the sole and only maker of maps. And if our weakness has been to confuse the bright and bloody colors of our calendars with the true weather of days, and the parchment’s territory of our maps with the lands spread out before us ― never mind. We’ve always been on our way to this new place ― that is no place, really ― but is real (Gibson 2000).</p>

          <h2 id="Ontology"><a href="#Ontology" class="headerlink" title="Ontology"></a>Ontology</h2><p>I’m a relativist. I think “reality exists as social, mental and experiential constructs”. To the extent that we all share these constructs - or appear to - then I’m also a constructivist. That which we might call “consensus reality” appears to exist and follow natural laws, with which we can work.</p>
<p>I have internalised another paradigm as well, through studying  and practicing Buddhism. I have come to understand the process of perception by which we construct consensus reality as a rolling series of misunderstandings about the actual nature of reality. This paradigm can accommodate the world view of all the paradigms except straight out positivism which is an exclusive stance.</p>
<h2 id="Epistemology"><a href="#Epistemology" class="headerlink" title="Epistemology"></a>Epistemology</h2><p>At the level of consensus reality, in terms of natuarl science, for example, I’m an empiricist. At this level, knowledge comes from experience. This includes knowledge gained through observation as well as through direct experience.</p>
<p>However, as Hursell observed, the empiricist idea that experience is the foundation of all knowledge is, itself, knowledge that can not be based on experience of the external world. It is based on the experience of being - specifically the experience of being in a world which we experience through our senses as phenomena. This is also a Buddhist perspective but in a Western academic context it is represented by Phenomenology.</p>
<p>I see all the paradigms as valid attitudes to knowledge - except perhaps, again, straight out positivism, which intrinsically tries to invalidate other ways of knowing.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>In my inclusive paradigm, all methodologies are valid as long as they are contextually appropriate to the ontological and epistemological stance we have adopted, hopefully to suit our purposes.</p>
